ArrayList is a part of the Java Collections Framework and provides a dynamic array-like data structure.
Unlike arrays, ArrayLists can dynamically grow and shrink in size as elements are added or removed.
ArrayLists can store elements of any data type.
Elements in an ArrayList are accessed using methods such as get() and set().
ArrayLists offer flexibility in resizing and manipulation but may have slightly slower performance compared to arrays for random access.

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>(); // Creates an ArrayList of Strings
list.add("Hello"); // Adds "Hello" to the ArrayList
